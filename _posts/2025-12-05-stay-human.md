AI cannot replace us, as humans, in connecting with each other. That's the true value of being human. The holy grail, in my opinion.

Today I went to an Asians in Tech social event in London. It was at a Taiwanese noodle bar, and I thought it would be "just another" networking dinner—reconnecting with folks, catching up, the usual stuff. When I walked in, I had no idea it was also a KTV. I hadn't been to one in over a decade.

We had all different Asian backgrounds: Indian, Chinese, Hongkongese, Taiwanese, mixed heritage, British-born Asian... Some of us knew each other well, while others were meeting for the first time, at least in person. Obviously the great food connected us, but the songs did too.

As humans, we don't just train for thousands of hours to grow up—we experience the world together with our beloved friends who grew up alongside us. We experienced all the uniqueness of that era. And pop songs are the records of those eras, making people recall the happiness and sadness of whatever had been.

Even though we might not have grown up together, not even in the same region, or even with the same mother tongue, when we sang those pop songs together, we recalled that era and connected. Because we share the same memory.

AI might be very good at generating all kinds of pop songs after learning from thousands and thousands of tracks, but it doesn't grow and experience the world as we humans do. There's [a scene in *Good Will Hunting*](https://youtu.be/8GY3sO47YYo) where Robin Williams's character tells Will that no matter how smart he is from reading books, he hasn't truly lived those experiences. AI is similar—it's like a smart kid who's read thousands of books and can describe the world by rephrasing others' words, but it never truly experiences and lives in the real world as we do. It won't experience happiness and sadness, ups and downs as we do. It won't truly understand the beauty and preciousness of humans helping each other without reason. It has no idea of the true value of the "passing on" spirit. I'm sure AI can mimic it quite nicely someday (or even now), but it's still not connecting humans as we do.

I still remember Nokia's slogan: "科技以人為本" (Technology centered on humanity). We should always keep that in mind.

AI is like the angels in the movie City of Angels - they know everything and are powerful, but [they don't understand taste as we do](https://youtu.be/MHckzPJuPKw?t=23). They can't experience the pleasure of enjoying great food as we do. Perhaps they can quantify yumminess or analyze all sorts of tastes, but they still can't truly understand the meaning and joy of having a good meal with family and friends as we do. Until they can experience the world as we do, we are still unique and irreplaceable.

Try to stay human as much as possible, my friend, even when the world is trying to make us like robots. Because we are not.
