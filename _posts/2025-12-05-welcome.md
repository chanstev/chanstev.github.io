Technology moves fast. But we shouldn't lose sight of what makes us human.

This blog is where I share thoughts on tech, AI, global talent, and Asians in tech. Not from a corporate perspective, but from someone in the trenches building systems, navigating borders, and trying to stay grounded.

I'm a Multi-Cloud Data & AI Architect and UK Global Talent Visa Ambassador. But this is my personal space—for exploring ideas, making mistakes, and learning in public.

**Stay Human.**
